### Removed Completed Consultations from Dashboard Calendars

## June 3, 2025

- Increased z-index from 10 to 50 to ensure modal appears above all other elements

## June 2, 2025 (Updated Thrice)

### Aligned Law Firm Signature Modal Trigger with Lawyer's Version
- Added `$this->dispatch('signature-modal-opened', ['case_id' => $caseId]);` to the `viewSignature` method in `app/Livewire/LawFirm/ManageCases.php`.
- This makes the law firm's signature viewing logic more consistent with the lawyer's implementation.
- The aim is to ensure the signature modal is correctly triggered and displayed, preventing the erroneous download of the contract.
- File modified: `app/Livewire/LawFirm/ManageCases.php`

## June 2, 2025 (Updated Again)

## June 2, 2025

### Fixed NotificationService Method Error in Law Firm Contract Sending
- Fixed an error that occurred when law firms attempted to send contracts to clients: "Call to undefined method App\Services\NotificationService::contractSentToClient()"
- The issue was in the `startCase()` method of the `app/Livewire/LawFirm/ManageCases.php` component

- **Solution**: Replaced with the correct `NotificationService::contractSent()` method which exists in the NotificationService class
- This ensures law firms can properly send contracts to clients without encountering errors
- File modified: `app/Livewire/LawFirm/ManageCases.php`

## June 1, 2025 (Updated)

### Fixed Law Firm Case Authorization Logic
- Fixed an issue where law firms were incorrectly receiving "You are not authorized to manage this case" errors
- The problem was in the authorization checks in `showStartCaseForm()` and `startCase()` methods of `ManageCases.php`
- The methods were incorrectly looking for a non-existent `law_firm_id` column in the `LegalCase` model
- **Solution**:
  - Replaced with proper authorization checks that verify:
    1. If the case is directly assigned to the law firm (`lawyer_id` equals the law firm's user ID)
    2. If the case is assigned to a lawyer who belongs to the law firm
  - Added detailed logging to help troubleshoot authorization issues
  - Renamed variables for clarity (`$isOwner` → `$isDirectlyAssigned`, `$isFirmLawyer` → `$isAssignedToFirmLawyer`)
- This ensures law firms can properly manage cases that are assigned to them or their lawyers
- File modified: `app/Livewire/LawFirm/ManageCases.php`

## June 1, 2025

### Fixed "Call to undefined method hasRole()" Error in Law Firm Case Management
- Fixed an error that occurred when law firms attempted to start a case: "Call to undefined method App\Models\User::hasRole()"
- The issue was in the `showStartCaseForm()` method of the `app/Livewire/LawFirm/ManageCases.php` component
- The method was incorrectly using `Auth::user()->hasRole('admin')` which doesn't exist in the User model
- **Solution**: Replaced with `Auth::user()->isAdmin()` which is an existing method in the User model
- This ensures law firms can properly open the Start Case modal to upload and send contracts to clients
- File modified: `app/Livewire/LawFirm/ManageCases.php`

## May 31, 2025 (Updated Further)

### Restored Start Case Button for Pending Cases
- Added back the "Start Case" button for cases with "Pending" status
- This allows law firms to send contracts to clients for pending cases
- The button triggers the contract upload modal via the `showStartCaseForm()` method
- File modified: `resources/views/livewire/law-firm/manage-cases.blade.php`

### Modified Law Firm Case Action Buttons
- Modified the law firm case management interface to simplify the action buttons
- **Retained buttons**:
  - "Start Case" button (for pending cases)
  - "Manage Case" button (main action button)
  - "View Signature" button (for signed contracts)
  - "Reassign Lawyer" button (inside the dropdown menu)
  - "Manage Team" button (inside the dropdown menu)
- **Removed buttons**:

- This simplifies the interface by focusing on the most important law firm actions for cases
- File modified: `resources/views/livewire/law-firm/manage-cases.blade.php`

### Fixed "Primary Lawyer" Check for Law Firms Closing Cases
- Addressed an issue where law firms were incorrectly told "Only the primary lawyer can close this case" even if they were designated as primary.
- The problem was in the `checkIfPrimaryLawyer()` method within `app/Livewire/LawFirm/CaseSetup.php`.
- **Solution**:
    - Refined the `checkIfPrimaryLawyer()` method to more accurately determine if the authenticated law firm has primary responsibility. It now checks:
        1. If the `LegalCase` is directly assigned to the law firm's user ID via `lawyer_id`.
        2. If the `LegalCase` is assigned to an individual lawyer who is an approved member of the authenticated law firm (verified via `LawFirmLawyer` table).
        3. If the law firm's user ID is explicitly marked as `is_primary` in the `case_lawyers` pivot table for that case.
        4. If an assigned lawyer (who is a member of the firm) is explicitly marked as `is_primary` in the `case_lawyers` pivot table.
    - Ensured that the `$this->isPrimaryLawyer` property in the `CaseSetup` component is set correctly in the `mount()` method using the updated `checkIfPrimaryLawyer()` logic.
- This allows law firms with primary responsibility (either directly or via their lawyers) to close cases without incorrect authorization messages.
- Files modified: `app/Livewire/LawFirm/CaseSetup.php`

## May 31, 2025 (Updated)

### Fixed Law Firm Case Access Authorization (403 Error)
- Resolved a 403 "You are not authorized to set up this case" error for law firms trying to access cases.
- The issue was in the authorization logic within the `mount()` method of `app/Livewire/LawFirm/CaseSetup.php`.
- The previous logic incorrectly used a non-existent `$case->lawFirm` relationship.
- **Solution**:
    - The logic now correctly identifies the authenticated law firm user and their `LawFirmProfile`.
    - It checks if the `LegalCase` (`$case`) has an assigned `lawyer_id`.
    - If so, it queries the `law_firm_lawyers` table to verify that the case's assigned lawyer (`$case->lawyer_id`) is an `approved` member of the authenticated law firm (`$firmProfile->id`).
    - Retained fallback checks for less common scenarios (e.g., direct assignment to the firm user ID, though the primary check is lawyer affiliation).
- This ensures that law firms can properly access cases assigned to their member lawyers.
- Files modified: `app/Livewire/LawFirm/CaseSetup.php`

## May 31, 2025

### Fixed Law Firm Dashboard Database Query Error
- Fixed an error in the law firm dashboard that was causing an "Unknown column 'law_firm_id'" SQL error
- The issue was in the `loadDeadlines` method of the `App\Livewire\LawFirm\Dashboard` class
- The query was incorrectly trying to use a non-existent `law_firm_id` column in the `legal_cases` table
- Solution: Removed the problematic `orWhere('law_firm_id', Auth::id())` condition from the query
- The dashboard now correctly loads cases based only on the lawyer IDs associated with the firm
- This ensures the law firm dashboard loads properly without database errors

## May 30, 2025 (Updated)

### Revised Dashboard Layout: Consultations and Deadlines Above Calendar
- Further reorganized the layout of both the lawyer and law firm dashboards.
- **New Arrangement**: Consultations and Deadlines sections now appear side-by-side *above* the Calendar.
- The Calendar section is now positioned below these two sections, spanning the full width.

### Updated Lawyer Name Display in Navigation Bar
- Updated the navigation bar and menus to display lawyer's first and last name from their profile
- Previously, the generic User model name field was being used throughout the lawyer interface
- Now properly displays the lawyer's first_name and last_name from the lawyerProfile relationship
- Modified multiple locations in the lawyer navigation menu:
  - Desktop dropdown trigger
  - Desktop dropdown text
  - Mobile view profile information
  - Image alt attributes
- Added fallbacks to default to the regular name field if lawyer profile data is missing
- File modified:
  - `resources/views/lawyer/navigation-menu.blade.php`

- File modified:
  - `resources/views/components/layouts/app.blade.php` - Added Invoices link to lawyer navigation sections

### Fixed Livewire Dispatch Method in CaseInvoices Component
- Updated the CaseInvoices component to use the correct Livewire v3 dispatch method
- Previously using deprecated `dispatchBrowserEvent()` method which was causing an error:
  - "BadMethodCallException: Method App\Livewire\Lawyer\CaseInvoices::dispatchBrowserEvent does not exist"
- Replaced with the new `dispatch()` method which is the proper way to dispatch browser events in Livewire v3
- File modified:
  - `app/Livewire/Lawyer/CaseInvoices.php` - Updated the event dispatching code in the openInvoiceModal method
- This change resolves the error when creating invoices inside the lawyer/case/setup page

### Fixed Client Name Display in Main Lawyer Invoices Page
- Updated the main lawyer invoices page (`/lawyer/invoices`) to properly display client names from their profiles
- Previously, the page was showing the generic User model name field (`$invoice->client->name`)
- Now correctly displays the client's first and last name from the clientProfile relationship
- Made two changes:
  - Added eager loading for the `client.clientProfile` relationship in the InvoiceManagement component
  - Updated the view to display `$invoice->client->clientProfile->first_name` and `$invoice->client->clientProfile->last_name`

- This change improves consistency in how client names are displayed across the application

### Updated Client Name Display in Lawyer Cases List Page
- Modified the main lawyer cases list page (`/lawyer/cases`) to properly display the client's first and last name from their profile.
- Previously, the table was attempting to display the name directly from the User model, which did not consistently show the correct name.
- Now displays the client's first and last name from the eager-loaded `client.clientProfile` relationship.
- Eager loaded the `client.clientProfile` relationship in the `ManageCases` Livewire component for performance.
- This ensures consistent and correct display of client names in the lawyer's case list.

- Eager loaded the `client.clientProfile` relationship in the `CaseInvoices` Livewire component for performance.
- **Note:** User is still reporting that the client name in the main table is not displaying correctly, potentially due to missing client profile data in the database for some clients.
- This ensures consistent display of client names across the application and matches the approach used for lawyer names.
- Files modified:
  - `resources/views/livewire/lawyer/case-invoices.blade.php` - Updated client name display in the main table and the invoice detail modal.
  - `app/Livewire/Lawyer/CaseInvoices.php` - Added eager loading for client profile.

### Fixed Decline Button Issue in Upload Revised Contract Modal
- **Issue**: The "Decline Client's Changes" button was disabled even when text was entered in the decline reason textarea
- **Root Cause**: The textarea was using `wire:model.defer="declineReason"` which only updates the server-side value on form submission, but the button's disabled state was checking the server-side `$declineReason` value in real-time
- **Solution**: Changed `wire:model.defer="declineReason"` to `wire:model.live="declineReason"` to enable real-time updates
- **Result**: The button now enables immediately as the user types in the decline reason textarea
- Files modified:
  - `resources/views/livewire/law-firm/manage-cases.blade.php` - Changed textarea binding to live updates
- This ensures law firms can properly decline client changes by enabling the button as soon as they start typing a reason

### Fixed Upload Revised Contract Button Click Issue for Law Firms - RESOLVED
- **Root Cause Identified**: The modal was being rendered outside the Livewire component scope
- **Issue**: The "Upload Revised Contract" modal was placed after the closing `</div>` of the Livewire component, causing it to be outside the component's reactive scope
- **Solution**: Moved the modal inside the Livewire component before the closing div
- **Backend Confirmation**: Laravel logs showed the method was being called successfully and modal state was being set to true
- **Frontend Issue**: The modal was not displaying because it was outside the Livewire component's DOM scope
- Key changes made:
  - **Modal Placement**: Moved the Upload Revised Contract modal inside the main Livewire component div
  - **Script Placement**: Moved JavaScript debugging code to after the component closing div
  - **Component Structure**: Ensured all modals are within the Livewire component scope for proper reactivity
- Files modified:
  - `resources/views/livewire/law-firm/manage-cases.blade.php` - Fixed modal placement within component scope
- **Result**: The modal now displays properly when the "Upload Revised Contract" button is clicked
- This fix ensures that Livewire can properly manage the modal's visibility state and reactivity

### Enabled Law Firms to Send Revised Contracts for "Changes Requested by Client" Status
- Fixed missing functionality for law firms to upload revised contracts when clients request changes
- Added proper status display and action button for "changes_requested_by_client" status in law firm case management
- Key changes made:
  - **Status Display**: Added "Changes Requested by Client" status badge with yellow styling in the law firm cases table
  - **Action Button**: Added "Upload Revised Contract" button that appears when case status is "changes_requested_by_client"  
  - **Client Requests Display**: Shows a preview of client's requested changes in the status display
  - **Contract Revised Status**: Added "Contract Revised by Law Firm" status display for when law firms send revised contracts
- Files modified:
