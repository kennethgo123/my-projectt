# Client Name Display Fix in Invoice Management

## Problem
The invoice creation system was showing generic "User" names in the client dropdown instead of the clients' actual names from their profiles. This made it difficult for lawyers to identify which client they wanted to create an invoice for.

## Solution

### 1. Eager Load Client Profiles
We modified the client queries to eager load their profiles:

```php
$clientsQuery = User::whereHas('role', function($query) {
        $query->where('name', 'client');
    })
    ->with('clientProfile') // Eager load client profiles
    ->whereHas('clientConsultations', function($query) use ($lawyerId) {
        $query->where('lawyer_id', $lawyerId)
            ->where('status', 'completed');
    });
```

### 2. Enhanced Client Search
We improved the client search to include searching by first and last name in the client profiles:

```php
$clientsQuery->where(function($query) {
    $query->where('name', 'like', '%' . $this->searchClient . '%')
        ->orWhere('email', 'like', '%' . $this->searchClient . '%')
        ->orWhereHas('clientProfile', function($profileQuery) use ($query) {
            $profileQuery->where('first_name', 'like', '%' . $this->searchClient . '%')
                         ->orWhere('last_name', 'like', '%' . $this->searchClient . '%');
        });
});
```

### 3. Updated Dropdown Display
We modified the client selection dropdown to display the client's full name from their profile:

```php
<option value="{{ $client->id }}">
    @if($client->clientProfile)
        {{ $client->clientProfile->first_name }} {{ $client->clientProfile->last_name }}
    @else
        {{ $client->name }}
    @endif
    ({{ $client->email }})
</option>
```

### 4. Added Fallback Logic
We implemented a fallback to fetch clients with active cases if no clients with completed consultations were found:

```php
// If no clients found, fallback to those with cases
if ($this->clients->isEmpty()) {
    $this->clients = User::whereHas('role', function($query) {
            $query->where('name', 'client');
        })
        ->with('clientProfile') // Eager load client profiles
        ->whereHas('cases', function($query) use ($lawyerId) {
            $query->where('lawyer_id', $lawyerId);
        })
        ->get();
}
```

## Impact
This improvement provides a much better user experience for lawyers when creating invoices:

1. Lawyers can now see the client's actual name (first and last name) instead of the generic username
2. Adding the email address provides additional confirmation of client identity
3. The search functionality is more robust, allowing searches by name or email
4. The system now finds more relevant clients by searching across both completed consultations and active cases
