# Profile Page Cleanup - October 16, 2025

## Summary
Removed two-factor authentication and account deletion functionality from the user profile page for both clients and lawyers.

## Issue
The default Laravel profile page at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/user/profile` contained:
- Two-factor authentication management section
- Account deletion functionality

These features were not needed for the application and should be removed.

## Solution
Completely removed both features from the profile page and disabled them at the configuration level.

## Files Modified

### 1. Profile View Template
**File**: `resources/views/profile/show.blade.php`
**Changes**:
- Removed the two-factor authentication section (`@livewire('profile.two-factor-authentication-form')`)
- Removed the account deletion section (`@livewire('profile.delete-user-form')`)
- Removed associated section borders

### 2. Jetstream Configuration
**File**: `config/jetstream.php`
**Changes**:
- Commented out `Features::accountDeletion()` to disable account deletion feature
- Added comment explaining it was disabled per user request

### 3. Fortify Configuration  
**File**: `config/fortify.php`
**Changes**:
- Commented out `Features::twoFactorAuthentication()` configuration to disable 2FA
