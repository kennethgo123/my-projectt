# Case Management Updates - October 16, 2025

## Summary
Successfully implemented three key updates to the case management system:

## 1. Contract PDF-Only Requirement
**Issue**: Lawyers and law firms could upload contracts in multiple formats (PDF, DOC, DOCX)
**Solution**: Updated all contract validation rules to only accept PDF files

### Files Modified:
- `app/Livewire/LawFirm/StartCase.php`
- `app/Livewire/LawFirm/ManageConsultations.php`
- `app/Livewire/Lawyers/ManageConsultations.php`
- `app/Livewire/Lawyers/ManageCases.php`
- `app/Livewire/LawFirm/ManageCases.php`
- `app/Livewire/Lawyer/CaseDetails.php`

### Changes Made:
- Changed validation from `mimes:pdf,doc,docx` to `mimes:pdf` for all contract-related file uploads
- Updated error messages to reflect PDF-only requirement

## 2. Assigned Judge Field Removal
**Issue**: Court details included assigned judge fields that needed to be removed
**Solution**: Completely removed assigned judge functionality from case setup

### Files Modified:
- `resources/views/livewire/law-firm/case-setup.blade.php`
- `resources/views/livewire/lawyer/case-setup.blade.php`
- `app/Livewire/LawFirm/CaseSetup.php`
- `app/Livewire/Lawyer/CaseSetup.php`

### Changes Made:
- Removed assigned judges section from view templates (both edit modals and overview displays)
- Removed `$assignedJudges` property from all components
- Removed `addJudge()` and `removeJudge()` methods
- Updated `loadCourtDetails()` to exclude judge loading
- Updated `updateCourtDetails()` to exclude judge handling
- Removed judge validation rules
- **Additional Fix**: Removed assigned judge display from court details overview sections in all views
- Cleared view cache to remove compiled templates with old references

## 3. Past Date Prevention for Events and Tasks
**Issue**: Users could set events and tasks to dates that already happened
**Solution**: Added `after_or_equal:today` validation to all date fields

### Files Modified:
- `app/Livewire/Lawyer/CaseSetup.php`
- `app/Livewire/LawFirm/CaseSetup.php`
- `app/Livewire/Client/CaseView.php`
- `app/Livewire/Lawyer/CasePhaseManager.php`

### Changes Made:
Updated validation rules for:
- `newEventDate` and `editEventDate`
- `newTaskDueDate` and `editTaskDueDate`
- `eventStartDateTime` and `taskDueDate` in CasePhaseManager

All date validations now include `after_or_equal:today` to prevent past dates.

## Status
âœ… All three requirements have been successfully implemented and are ready for testing.
